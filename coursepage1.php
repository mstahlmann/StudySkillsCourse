      <h3>Processing Assignment</h3>
        <p>1. In the past, have you taken responsibility for your education? If so, how? If not, who did you feel was responsible?
        <br>2. In the lesson video, we said that you are NOT a container that an instructor pours information into. Think of a word picture (analogy) to describe an Active Learner.
        <br>3. Explain how you can view yourself as CEO of your education. How would running your education like a business change the way you view school and studying?
        <br>4. If school and test preparation were like preparing for a theater performance, how would it affect the time you spend learning, studying and preparing for an exam?
        <br>5. Write out the formula for learning in your own words.
        <br>6. Explain what you think it means to have a Study Conversation and to ask questions of your textbook and your class notes.
        <br>7. Explain in your own words what it means to partner with your teacher?
        <br>8. List the different ways that a syllabus can help you be an excellent learner.
        <br>9. Describe how grading algorithms and rubrics are similar to business contracts?

      <h3>Application Assignment</h3>
      <p>
        <br>1.What changes will you make today and in the future to take full responsibility for your education and to CHOOSE to learn?
        <br>2.Why do you want to succeed?
        <br>3.How would your life change if you became a person who is excellent in every area?
        <br>4.Choose three highly successful companies and research their mission statements. Then, write a mission statement for your Learning Business.
        <br>5.What kind of return on investment do you want for the time you are spending in school?
        <br>6.Create a T-Chart by drawing a line down the center of a blank piece of lined paper. On the left side, list all of the steps you can think of to prepare for a great theater performance. Donâ€™t forget to include things such as sets, costumes, props, music, acting, lighting, etc. For each item in the left column, write a similar step in the right column that a student would take to prepare to ace an exam.
        <br>7.If you were going to try to learn how a clock works, what questions would you ask? Think of as many questions as it would take to become a mini-expert on how a clock works.
        <br>8.Write a job description that explains your expectations of a teacher as a valuable member of your learning team.
        <br>9.Imagine that you are a history teacher. Write a rubric for a research paper on the Civil War. 
        <br>10.Write a scenario that might cause you to need to meet with your teacher, and write a script for how you would approach the teacher as a valuable member of your team.
