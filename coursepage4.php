      <h3>Application Assignment</h3>
      <p>
        <br>1.In the lesson, we went through how to survey a textbook chapter. Using the same steps, survey the chapter on your own. For your assignment, you can simply let us know that you completed this step.
        <br>2.Decide how you are going to organize your notes. Read the chapter one section at a time and have a sticky pad available to you. Do not stop to take notes, but write any unfamiliar words or questions you have throughout each section of the chapter. When you are finished reading each section, donâ€™t forget to look up unfamiliar words and reread the paragraph with your understanding of the word. Let us know if you jotted down any unfamiliar terms or questions.
        <br>3.When you are done reading one section, look for the big ideas. Summarize each idea into short statements, and then create bulleted lists of supporting points under the main idea. Attach your completed notes as a document to your assignment.
        <br>4.Begin building your vocabulary list according to the lesson. Be sure to look up a definition for each word. Attach your completed vocabulary list as a document to your assignment.
        <br>5.There are three types of questions you will ask yourself as you pre-learn. For each section of the text, write questions for each type of pre-learning question.
        <br>6.Test yourself. Without referring back to the text or your notes, answer the end of the chapter questions in the sample text. Create a separate page called STUDY QUESTIONS for any questions you could not answer. Include your answers and study questions in this assignment.
        <br>7.Gather the questions you jotted down throughout your note taking process. If your questions remain unanswered by the end of the chapter, Google them, and tell us what you found.
        <br>8.Survey a non-fiction book (in your home or library) that will give you further information about goal setting.
        <br>9.As you survey the non-fiction book, include new information on goal setting not found in your sample text. Be sure to  include an MLA citation at the top of your notes.
